# Bobby the Bird – Unity 2D Game

Bobby the Bird is a simple Flappy Bird–style 2D game made in Unity. The goal is to guide Bobby through gaps between moving pipes while earning as many points as possible.

Gameplay

* Player Movement:
Tap/click/press space to flap Bobby upward. Gravity pulls him down, so timing is key.

* Scoring System:
You earn 1 point each time Bobby successfully passes through a pair of pipes.
The score is displayed on-screen during gameplay.

* Obstacles (Pipes):
Pipes spawn at random heights and move from right to left.
Colliding with any pipe or the ground ends the game.

* Particle Effects:
Particle systems are used to enhance visuals (e.g., flap effects, score effects, or collision particles depending on your setup).

* Main Menu

Start button to begin the game.
